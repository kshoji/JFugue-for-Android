<h1>Simple API for XML (SAX)</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
SAX is the Simple API for XML, originally a Java-only API. SAX was 
the first widely adopted API for XML in Java, and is a "de facto"
standard. The current version is SAX 2.0, and there are versions 
for several programming language environments other than Java. 
</p>
<h2>Copyright Status</h2>
<p>
<i>SAX is free!</i>
</p>
<p>
In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, since it's 
been placed in the public domain. 
</p>
<h2>No Warranty</h2>
<p>
Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty 
for the design or for the software implementation, to the extent 
permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in 
writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide SAX "as 
is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, 
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire 
risk as to the quality and performance of SAX is with you. Should 
SAX prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, 
repair or correction.
</p>
<p>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in 
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may 
modify and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, 
including any general, special, incidental or consequential 
damages arising out of the use or inability to use SAX (including 
but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate 
or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the 
SAX to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or 
other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
