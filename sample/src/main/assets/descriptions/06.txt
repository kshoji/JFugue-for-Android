Twelve-bar blues uses a I-IV-V chord progression. But really, it's the Major 7ths that you'd like to hear... and if you want to play each chord in arpeggio, you need a 6th in there as well. But creating a I7%6-IV7%6-V7%6 chord progression is messy. So, this code creates a I-IV-V progression, then distributes a 7%6 across each chord, then creates the twelve bars, and then each chord is played as an arpeggio with note dynamics (note on velocity - how hard you hit the note). Finally, the pattern is played with an Acoustic_Bass instrument at 110 BPM. With all of the method chaining, that is kinda done in one line of code.
